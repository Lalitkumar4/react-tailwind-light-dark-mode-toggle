# Light/Dark mode toggle

This project shows how to use Tailwind CSS in combination with CSS variables in React to control the light/dark mode theme, rather than using the Tailwind CSS dark mode property.  It also stores the theme using localStorage so that it doesn't reset when the page is reloaded.
